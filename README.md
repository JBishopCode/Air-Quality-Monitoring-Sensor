# Engineering 1020 Final Lab Project

# Air Quality Monitoring System
This project is made in partial requirements for the ENGI 1020 (Intro to programming with python) course, which is offered at Memorial University of Newfoundland (St. John's Campus)

I have made a Air Quality Monitoring System that detects unsafe air conditons using Arduino sensors with Python. 

It monitored temperature, air pressure, and humidity. 

The moudular system then monitors historical data trends so that it can alert users via email or buzzer. It also visualizes data trends through graphs. 

To run the python code, you have to first run the required firmware on your Arduino, and pip install the required modules(mainly engi1020). For instructions, please email/message me.
